Another great hit from The Teaching Company's earlier years (this was from 1998, I believe), RFSC helped shore up a number of gaps in my understanding. It was interesting to approach Stalin after learning Mao's history in greater detail, since I could see the influence but wrapped my mind around Chinese communism with more of a blank slate. As the professor notes, one of the most horrifying things about Stalinist terror was that it was successfully exported.
At this stage my Ankifying notebooks have achieved minimal-config levels. I just get all the audio files and chunk out the guidebook, fix a couple lines in the prompts, and prepare my wallet for the OpenAI API fees at the end of the month.

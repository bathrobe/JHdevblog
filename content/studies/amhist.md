I started this course last winter, when my girlfriend and I watched the early lectures at dinnertime. Later on, we stopped eating dinner with a TV nearby (recommend) but I kept going. The middle professor of the three is the same one that did the intensive Civil War course I'd watched previously, though he was equally good here--direct, clear, insightful.

There was just so much. I started this course before I figured out a good GPT-4 system and so tried to manually take notes and create cards, similar to Everyday Engineering. This was just too much work though. I'll settle for the background overview. My favorite section was the last one, with Professor Allitt, who had these wonderful sociological profiles of historical peoples, especially in the reconstruction years. He was always citing popular books from the time period and describing them, had contagious enthusiasm, and was all around a joy to listen to.

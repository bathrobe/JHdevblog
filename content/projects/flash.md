For buildspace.so's hackathon I designed a project I've been thinking about for a long time. Using spaced repetition and LLMs, I created a "learning gym" where selected online course playlists from YouTube could be reviewed using active learning, transcript summaries, and vector search Q&As, then studied and drilled indefinitely using an SRS flashcard system I built myself. It was a wild ride in which I learned a great deal about entrepreneurship, fullstack dev work, and engaging with the public to solicit feedbacks on early products.

Here's how you can check it out:

- Visit the app itself (log in to try out some of the lessons, though be advised they're still rough prototypes) at [Flashbang](https://flashbang.school)
- Watch my [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfnOW8psNKk)
- Check out the [Substack](https://www.flashbangapp.substack.com) I created to update supporters on my progress

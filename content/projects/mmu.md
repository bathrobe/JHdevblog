I developed a series of Colab notebooks that take the transcripts of Timothy Snyder's "[Making of Modern Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJczLlwp-d8)" course from Yale University and create from them spaced repetition flashcards for Anki using GPT-4.

I'm currently working on an article about this process, but for now you can check out two of the Colab notebooks here:

- [Flashcard generator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14K63SBlyD_aCBWDxYyNdUt7X__A06laa)

And you can download the whole course's Anki flashcards [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rS6vddF6jJpEMzFONzus-8rpzEdGKzRB/view?usp=drive_link).
